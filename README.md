# Machine-Learning-Guide
One question that has frequently come my way lately is, “How can one embark on their AI journey?” A few years ago, answering this question would have been straightforward. However, with the recent rapid advancements spanning various AI domains, particularly in NLP and computer vision, and the abundance of online resources available today, outlining a comprehensive roadmap has become a nuanced task.

After careful consideration, I’ve crafted a straightforward yet potent A-to-Z curriculum. This guide is designed to be inclusive, catering to individuals with diverse backgrounds — whether they are newcomers to the field or professionals seeking a career shift. These resources can also be beneficial for advanced ML engineers who want to refresh some concepts.


# Structure
The structure of this guide is deliberate. It commences with addressing common hurdles faced by beginners and provides insights on navigating them effectively. Following this, I’ll share a personally curated list of online resources.
Since this repository is beginner-friendly, I only included structured courses in the main curriculum because they are organized and easier to follow.

# Contributions
This repo is open to all kinds of contributions related to the machine-learning journey.
