# Machine-Learning-Curriculum
One question that has frequently come my way lately is, “_How can one embark on their AI journey_?” A few years ago, answering this question would have been straightforward. However, with the recent rapid advancements spanning various AI domains, particularly in NLP and computer vision, and the abundance of online resources available today, outlining a comprehensive roadmap has become a nuanced task.

After careful consideration, I’ve crafted a straightforward yet potent A-to-Z curriculum. This guide is designed to be inclusive, catering to individuals with diverse backgrounds — whether they are newcomers to the field or professionals seeking a career shift. These resources can also be beneficial for advanced ML engineers who want to refresh some concepts.

# Structure
The structure of this guide is deliberate and includes a personally curated list of online courses. Since this repository is beginner-friendly, I only included important structured courses in the main curriculum because they are organized and easier to follow. Additional resources will be added in separate sections. Take the main curriculum courses in order for better understanding.

# Contributions
This repository is open to all kinds of contributions related to the **machine learning** journey. However, there are some considerations:
- Since the purpose here is to make a straightforward guide, additional courses, and books won't be added to the main curriculum. Rather they will be added in a separate section.
- If a course meets standards, it will become a part of the main curriculum.
- Resources can include both free and paid courses.
- Make sure to follow the format for resources i.e. name, links, and institute/person.
- Resources can include YouTube channels, papers, blog posts, online courses, and book recommendations.

# Note
There aren't many resources related to MLOps included in this repository since I am planning to create a separate repository for that.

# Some Tips
- AI learning is a journey, not a sprint; success requires resisting impatience, embracing challenges, and fostering a deep understanding of AI principles despite the temptation for quick results.
- Broaden your machine learning understanding through diverse resources like instructors, courses, books, research papers, and blogs for a well-rounded grasp of artificial intelligence.
- Focus on mastering one concept at a time for a solid foundation and effective learning.
- Theory is vital, but true understanding comes from hands-on implementation; actively engage with knowledge, invest time in real-world problem-solving, and trust the process for profound insights.
- AI success requires technical skills and more—embrace GitHub, Docker, diverse programming languages, paper-reading, cloud computing, project management, and strong writing/documentation for adaptability in the evolving industry.
